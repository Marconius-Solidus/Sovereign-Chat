# Streamlit + Langchain + LLama.cpp w/ Mistral

Run your own AI Chatbot locally without a GPU.

To make that possible, we use the [Mistral 7b](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/) model.  
However, you can use any quantized model that is supported by [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp).

This model will chatbot will allow you to define it's personality and respond to the questions accordingly.  
There is not chat memory, so you won't be able to ask follow up questions.

# TL;DR instructions

1. Install llama-cpp-python
2. Install langchain
3. Install streamlit
4. Run streamlit

# Step by Step instructions
